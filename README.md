# House Price Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning models. We explore the performance of multiple algorithms to determine the best approach for accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata). It contains various features related to house characteristics.
## Preprocessing Steps

The data preprocessing involved the following steps:

- Finding Correlation: Analyzed the correlation between features to understand their relationships and impact on the target variable.

- Identifying Outliers: Detected and handled outliers to improve model performance.

- Normalization/Standardization: Applied scaling techniques to ensure that the features have a uniform range, which helps in improving the model's accuracy.
## Modeling

We applied the following machine learning algorithms to predict house prices:

- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors

These models were trained on the processed data and evaluated to determine their performance.
## Evaluation

The models were evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictions.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning models for predicting house prices. The evaluation results help in identifying the most effective model for this task.
